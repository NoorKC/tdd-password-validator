# 🔐 TDD Password Validator in Java

A password validation program built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. Includes test cases using JUnit to ensure password security rules are enforced correctly.

## 🧪 Features

- Validate password strength based on length, character types, and rules
- Includes unit tests using JUnit 4
- Modular code with separation between validation logic and testing

## 🧱 File Breakdown

- `Password.java`: Core password validation logic
- `PasswordTest.java`: JUnit test cases
- `Main.java`: Simple runner (optional)
- `lib/`: JUnit and Hamcrest libraries

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Import the project into a Java IDE that supports JUnit (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse)
2. Make sure the `lib/` folder is added to your project’s build path
3. Run the tests using the IDE’s test runner

## ✅ TDD Workflow

This project follows the TDD approach:
1. Write test → 2. Write code → 3. Refactor → 4. Repeat
